1. Download and install Firefox from the official website: [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox). <br>
2. Open Firefox and log in to your YouTube account.   <br>
3. To be sure everything is working, play any video on YouTube.   <br>
4. Close Firefox completely before launching Freedom Loader.  <br>
5. Start Freedom Loader and try your download.
