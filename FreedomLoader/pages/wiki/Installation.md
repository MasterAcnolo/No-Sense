# Installation
## System Requirements
- Windows 11 (Windows 10 might work, but not tested)  
- A computer that can run Windows and electricity at the same time (Sorry, potatoes are not supported yet)  
- Firefox Browser and a valid youtube session. I Mean, you need to have the browser installed, and be connected at least once on youtube.com site. If you need some help, check **Firefox** Section.
## Steps
1. Download the latest version from the [official page](download.html)  <br>
2. Run the installer and follow the steps <br>
3. Launch Freedom Loader from the Start menu or desktop shortcut <br>
4. Before or after installation, launch **Firefox** and go on youtube.com <br>
5. Then, connect your google account to **Youtube**. After that, you can try to start a video, then close the browser. <br>
6. You can now enjoy **Freedom Loader** Experience ! 

## Update
Freedom Loader should update itself at launch, including yt‑dlp.  
If the update fails, try restarting the app or checking the logs.  
You can also run the application as an Administrator if needed.

## Tips
Put your antivirus on pause during the operation. Personally I use one and when I test and download the .exe, if he is not in pause, he is spamming and blocking the process.
