# Common Issues
Here are some common problems you might encounter when using Freedom Loader, and how to deal with them.

## 1. Not logged in to YouTube / Cookies not retrieved
If you are not logged into YouTube on a supported browser (Firefox, Chrome, or Edge), Freedom Loader may not be able to access your cookies.  
**Solution:** Log in to YouTube using one of the supported browsers.


## 2. Antivirus blocking the app
Some antivirus programs may flag Freedom Loader at first launch.  
**Solution:** Temporarily disable your antivirus while launching the app, or add Freedom Loader to the antivirus whitelist.


## 3. Cookies are outdated
If your cookies are expired or outdated, downloads may fail.  
**Solution:** Reconnect to your browser account to refresh cookies.


## 4. Unable to retrieve all information for certain videos or playlists
Not all videos or playlists can be fully processed. Some may fail to load or provide incomplete info.  
**Solution:** This is usually a limitation of yt-dlp or YouTube itself. Try updating Freedom Loader and yt-dlp, or skip the problematic video/playlist. I Apologize for that, but the download should be working well.
