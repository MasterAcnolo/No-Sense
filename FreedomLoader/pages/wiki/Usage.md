# Usage
## First Launch
At the **first launch**, your antivirus might flag the app. If it happens, temporarily disable it.  
During the first requests/downloads, you may see a warning like *“Freedom Loader is trying to access your Firefox cookies.”*  
Relax - this is only for the yt‑dlp cookie bypass. More details here: [See Articles](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp)

## Notice
You need a web browser and must be logged in to YouTube with a valid Google account.  
If not, yt‑dlp can’t retrieve your cookies. Supported browsers:

- Firefox  (Sorry, it's only for cookies. You can get your URL on whatever browser you want brother)

*If you need some help to install Firefox, follow the tutorial on Firefox Section* <br>

**Sorry if this forces you to log into YouTube using one of these browsers - that’s a limitation from yt‑dlp, not from Freedom Loader.**
