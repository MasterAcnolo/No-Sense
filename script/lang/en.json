{"lyrics":"[Intro]\nYamakasi, Yamakasi, Yamakasi-kasi\nYamakasi, Yamakasi, Yamakasi-kasi\n\n[Verse 1: Miyagi]\nMy little ghetto won't leave anything unanswered\nEvery argument here is like a fing House of Soviets\nThey uproot our roots, but there’s little chance they'll succeed\nThe mentality side is recruiting new soldiers\nGaining momentum, our views have been reinterpreted\nFor the deeds of our grandfathers, we built monuments\nWe stood for love — each of us is devoted, no doubt\nTo that neighborhood romance and generational bond\nHere, a broken guy found fire, and let it burn bright\nI’m uplifted, and f whoever tries to change my mood\nI’m dissatisfied with my badman for a reason — it’s dangerous\nI smoked this agony and spat out the compass\nThe one that lied and told me to forget all that’s good\nOrdzhonikidze, my hometown, a forge of heroes\nAnd let all evil burn like Troy once did\nBecause this is my Detroit and my paranoia\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Miyagi]\nMy immeasurably pure side\nWelcomed guests with justice\nSmiled at those who were close to us in spirit\nAnd chased away the stench and absurdities\nThe beauty of this city burned fiercely\nIt scorched with news bulletins\nI pray to God for you, Motherland, my dear one\nI’m with you alone until the end, even if it kills me\n\n[Chorus: Miyagi & Andy Panda]\nMy immeasurably pure side\nWelcomed guests with justice\nSmiled at those who were close to us in spirit\nAnd chased away the stench and absurdities\nThe beauty of this city burned fiercely\nIt scorched with news bulletins\nI pray to God for you, Motherland, my dear one\nI’m with you alone until the end, even if it kills me (Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Bridge: Andy Panda]\nThe wind blew everyone away, tears on the block\nWith a wise morning comes a new day, I brought her roses\nA man’s burden flows into the path with kind light\nGive them strength, and may hardships be blown away as well\n\n[Verse 2: Andy Panda]\nLike this, like that — something’s wrong, f***\nI wanted it to be better, that’s a fact\nDarkness, or I messed it up\nOr both, at first glance, this is heaven and hell\nClick-clack, as long as it looms, bro\nThis device carries a verbal charge\nIn the crosshairs, in the crosshairs — anyone who breaks in\nDon’t stick your nose in here, Pinocchio — you’ll be met with an axe\nThe five-story buildings remember Andy\nThe five-stories — nostalgia, I lift the ashes\nIn front of my eyes — my mother and kind neighbors\nFlashbacks — I treasure that\nI picture a brotherly city\nWith its own Batman, but without a mask\nThere’s a reason to love it; a reason to say:\nCome visit if you love to dream\n\n[Refrain]\nYamakasi, Yamakasi, Yamakasi-kasi\nYamakasi, Yamakasi, Yamakasi-kasi\nYamakasi, Yamakasi, Yamakasi-kasi\nYamakasi, Yamakasi, Yamakasi-kasi\n\n[Chorus: Miyagi]\nMy immeasurably pure side\nWelcomed guests with justice\nSmiled at those who were close to us in spirit\nAnd chased away the stench and absurdities\nThe beauty of this city burned fiercely\nIt scorched with news bulletins\nI pray to God for you, Motherland, my dear one\nI’m with you alone until the end, even if it kills me"}
